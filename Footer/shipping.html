    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <a href="#">We expect orders to ship within 2-6 business days given current policies and procedures to protect the health and safety of our fulfillment team. Once each package is out the door, you’ll automatically receive tracking information so you can keep an eye out for it. Once in transit, packages take 1-4 business days to arrive. We do not have control over carrier service disruptions or delays once shipped.
        Plants and botanicals that are part of the same order may ship separately from different locations, so your order could arrive in multiple packages on slightly different timelines. You'll receive order tracking information for each item once shipped.
        Note: We carry an assortment of products from independent makers and brands that share our aesthetic, values, and vibe. These products ship directly from the third party vendor or artisan within 2-6 business days, unless noted otherwise on the product page.</a>
